PARCP Quick start guide:
========================

You've got two computers. One will be PARCP Client (usually the one you
want to work on) and the other one will be PARCP Server (you don't need
its monitor nor keyboard as it will work unattended).

A) Atari users (TOS/MiNT/MagiC):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) start PAR_IN.PRG (not required when using PARCP-USB adapter)
2) connect PARCP cable or the PARCP-USB adapter to parallel port
3) start PARCP.TTP (or PARSERVE.TOS if Atari is to be the Server)

B) Apple or PC users (DOS/Windows/Linux/Raspbian):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) start PAR_IN (not required when using PARCP-USB adapter)
2) connect PARCP or USB cable (from the PARCP-USB adapter) to your PC
3) start PARCP (or PARSERVE if PC is to be the Server)

This should start PARCP in its fullscreen interface for easy copying
of files. But that's not the top of PARCP features! PARCP is able to copy
by simple drag&drop of files onto PARCP Client icon, or even
work fully automatically driven by commands in script files.
