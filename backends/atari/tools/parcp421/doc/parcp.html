<H1><BR><A NAME="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction
</H1>
<P>
This is the second try of an useful documentation, I'm not good at that...
Please read it if you can. If you're too impatient and can't read whole
documentation before first start of PARCP, please read the "Quick, Three
lines guide to PARCP installation and use" in the <A HREF="quick.txt">QUICK.TXT</A> file.


<H2><BR><A NAME="Introduction1"></A> 1.1 What is PARCP?
</H2>
<P>
PARCP stands for PARallel CoPier. It does copy files between two computers.
It acts as a file network running over parallel (=printer) ports of those
computers. This allows you to copy many and large files very quickly from
one machine to another, either by simple drag &amp; drop, or automated in batch
mode or you can choose from two different user interfaces (command line like
in a FTP client and fullscreen windows just like Norton Commander).
In 2014 I developed <a href="http://joy.sophics.cz/parcp/parcp-usb.html">PARCP-USB</a>
adapter that allows to interconnect computers with parallel ports (Atari and old PC
machines) with computers that have USB ports (all newer computers basically). So
PARCP is no longer tied with parallel ports only.


<H2><BR><A NAME="Introduction2"></A> 1.2 Advantages of PARCP
</H2>
<P>
 It's cheap, it's fast, it's available everywhere, and it's easy to setup and use.
<UL>
<LI>[cheap and easy]
<P>
  The PARCP cable is all that's needed to connect two computers, and it can
  be build for very few bucks. You can even look around and if you find
  parallel LapLink cable, you need nothing but PARCP!<BR>
  With the PARCP-USB adapter you can use an ordinary USB cable. No need to solder anything.
<P>
<LI>[fast and available everywhere]
<P>
  Connecting two computers with the cable takes only few seconds. All computers
  have either parallel ports or USB ports.
<P>
<LI>[easy]
<P>
  Not requiring a netcard also means that apart from connecting the cables,
  everything else is software configuration (which in principle could be
  made very easy).
<P>
<LI>[available everywhere]
<P>
  PARCP can connect two computers running different operating systems. No
  need to search for a common network protocol, PARCP itself is the 'common
  protocol'.
<P>
<LI>[easy and fast]
<P>
  PARCP needs not to be 'installed' in the way you know it from Microsoft
  operating systems - complicated procedure, several reboots, no ability to
  uninstall. No! PARCP can be just unpacked and started - and it works!
  Without reboots, without conflicts with other hardware or software
  components, without headaches...
<P>
<LI>[available everywhere and easy]
<P>
  PARCP can even connect two different platforms, like is IBM PC or clone
  and Atari ST (or compatible). For Atari computers it's even more
  important, because there are nearly no network cards.
<P>
<LI>[fast and easy]
<P>
  Sometimes a ZIP disk is used to transfer files from one computer to
  another - first copy files from one computer to ZIP, then copy files from
  ZIP to another computer.
<P>
  Is that easy? Fast? No!
<P>
  PARCP easily outperforms parallel ZIP in reading - so if you connect
  those two computers with a PARCP cable, it's more than two times faster
  to copy the same amount of data from one computer to another.
</UL>


<H2><BR><A NAME="IntroductionUSB"></A> 1.3 PARCP and USB
</H2>
<P>
With the invention of PARCP-USB adapter the PARCP got zero setup on a PC and it's also generally simpler
to use on Atari. You just plug the PARCP-USB adapter into your Atari or old PC and start PARCP software. No need to configure
anything. No need to bother with PAR_IN. You don't care about PC parallel port number, its type, BIOS setup, current input/output state etc.
 Luckily USB devices are plug&amp;play and PARCP software detects everything automatically.
<P>
Best of all, with PARCP-USB it's much safer to interconnect two computers. Actually the connection can be permanent and you can turn
on/off any of the two computers freely. There's no danger compared to using the special PARCP cable that requires some caution.
<P>
<STRONG>The great thing is that with PARCP-USB you just plug&amp;play - and ignore all sections of this document that talk about PARCP cable, parallel port setup or issues with it.</STRONG>

<H2><BR><A NAME="Introduction3"></A> 1.4 Features
</H2>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Features1"></A>   1.4.1 Supported computer platforms
</H3>
<P>
PARCP has been designed to work on two different computer platforms:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon and compatible computers (Medusa/Hades).
    PARCP is also compatible with all sorts of accelerator cards such
    as AfterBurner040 or CT60 for Falcon etc. Milan is not supported yet because it
    lacks the ST-compatible parallel port.
<P>
  <LI> IBM PC 386 and compatible clones (i.e. machines with 32-bit x86 CPU).
    PARCP has been tested succesfully on AMD 386, Intel 486, Intel Pentium,
    Cyrix 6x86 and M2 as well as on AMD K6-2 processors.<BR>
    Nowadays also 64-bit AMD and Intel CPUs are supported. And PARCP runs even on ARM!
</UL>
<P>
 <I>
 I will use the word <STRONG>Atari</STRONG> as a general reference for any of the computers with
 Motorola CPU inside and running TOS or compatible operating system (MiNT/MagiC)
 and the word <STRONG>PC</STRONG> for any computer with Intel or compatible CPU and running
 DOS or compatible operating system (DOS/Windows9x/OS/2 for PARCP with cable, Windows XP and up for PARCP-USB) or Linux based one.
 </I>
<P>
The main feature of PARCP is the ability of connecting of any two supported
computers:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> Atari <=====> Atari<BR>
  <LI> Atari <=====> PC<BR>
  <LI> PC    <=====> PC<BR>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Features2"></A>   1.4.2 Parallel (=printer) port type (PC only, not for PARCP-USB)
</H3>
<P>
Parallel ports of PC computers are basically of two different types:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> unidirectional
  <LI> bidirectional
</UL>
<P>
  In addition, enhanced parallel ports (EPP and ECP) are supported as well
and are programmed as bidirectional ones.
<P>
The unidirectional parallel port is not able to read bytes on data lines
but has got five additional input lines for various purposes. Nearly all
known programs use these additional input lines for reading 4-bit nibbles.
They use so called 'LapLink' cable and 'LapLink' method of transferring data.
<P>
On the contrary, PARCP together with UNI-BI interface can read data
by full 8-bit at once just like on bidirectional parallel port.
Simply said PARCP UNI-BI interface makes you bidirectional parallel port from
your old unidirectional one.
That's why PARCP is usually about two times faster than its competitors!
<P>
If you have got an ECP or a EPP parallel port, then PARCP should work
at the full speed and no hardware interface is needed.
<P>
Of course PARCP supports all standard parallel ports of PC - you can
choose which one you will use for PARCP transfers in the process of
configuration with PARCPCFG.


<H3><BR><A NAME="Features3"></A>   1.4.3 Supported operating systems
</H3>
<P>
PARCP comes in three different binary files compiled for three supported
platforms: Atari, DOS/Windows and Linux.
All three binary versions of PARCP look and behave exactly the same way,
which is good for user learning its capabilities.

<H4>
  Atari computers (any model):
</H4>
<UL>
    <LI> TOS 1.04+
    <LI> MiNT
    <LI> MagiC
</UL>
<H4>
  PC computers with PARCP cable:
</H4>
<UL>
    <LI> DOS flavors (MS-DOS, DR DOS, FreeDOS)
    <LI> Microsoft Windows95/Windows98/WindowsME (32-bit DOS application with LFN support)
    <LI> OS/2 (in DOS mode)
    <LI> Linux on i386/amd64 (native application)
</UL>
<H4>
  PC computers with PARCP-USB:
</H4>
<UL>
    <LI> Microsoft WindowsXP/Vista/7/8+ on i386/amd64 (new native application!)
    <LI> Linux on i386/amd64/ARMv6 (native application)
</UL>
<P>
    <H5>Microsoft WindowsNT/Windows2000/WindowsXP and PARCP cable</H5>
    Please note the old PARCP 3.90 can't run under WindowsNT/W2K/WXP out-of-the-box
    because these operating systems don't allow user programs to access
    the hardware registers of parallel ports directly. There are several 3rd party
    drivers for Windows that can overcome that and allow PARCP to run:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.embeddedtronics.com/public/Electronics/minidaq/userport/UserPort.zip">UserPort</a> (tested by Michael Schmid and reported to work) </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.beyondlogic.org/porttalk/porttalk.htm">PortTalk</a>  (another possible solution, untested)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.zeecube.com/">ParPort2004</a> (commercial solution, tested by me) </li>
    </ul>
    For LFN support (long file names) you may try installing the following driver: <a href="http://clio.rice.edu/djgpp/ntlfn08b.zip">NT LFN TSR</a>
    <BR>
    If you need to copy some files from a NTFS formatted drive without diving into the WindowsNT+ headaches you can either
    use <A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com">NTFS driver for DOS/Windows9x</A>
    that will allow you to read NTFS under plain DOS or Windows, or you can
    use a recent version of Linux kernel (2.4.x) that contains NTFS driver.
    <H5>PARCP-USB requires WindowsXP or newer</H5>
    PARCP-USB adapter, contrary to the PARCP cable, requires newer Windows OS (because DOS does not support USB). The PARCP v3.94+
    comes with a native MS-Windows binary that runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.
<H4>
Main PARCP features under multitasking operating systems (all but single TOS):
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> <H5> non-blocking waiting for user action </H5>
    PARCP doesn't hog OS nor CPU while waiting for user - the average load
    is close to zero when PARCP is idle. Therefore other applications
    continue working at full speed when PARCP is waiting. Thus you can have
    PARCP Server running all the time in the background, always ready for transmission.
<P>
  <LI> <H5> support of long file names (LFN) and file attributes </H5>
    PARCP allows you to copy files from one operating system to another
    with original long file names preserved. Some rather unusual combinations
    of possible transfers of long file names between different environments
    are listed here:
<P>
  <UL>
    <LI> Windows95's V-FAT <=====> MiNT's minix-fs<BR>
    <LI> Linux's ext2-fs   <=====> MagiC's V-FAT<BR>
    <LI> MiNT's ISO9660    <=====> OS/2's HPFS<BR>
  </UL>
</UL>


<H3><BR><A NAME="Features5"></A>   1.4.4 User Interface
</H3>
<P>
PARCP 3.x comes with two different users interfaces. Historically first is
the FTP-like, command line interface (CLI). Now the preferred interface is
the new, fullscreen, easy to use, arrow and function keys driven
(ParShell). If you've ever seen programs like Norton Commander, Volkov
Commander, Midnight Commander or alike, the ParShell will be familiar to
you.
<P>
The working environment can be utilized to your personal needs by many
switches and parameters (please look into section 3.2.4).
<P>
PARCP can also be used in non-interactive way, without any user interface.
This includes sending files by simple drag &amp; drop onto PARCP's icon on
desktop (TOS 2.x, MultiTOS, MagiC, Windows95) and also script files
processing (see section 4.4).
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Features6"></A>   1.4.5 Internals
</H3>
<P>
PARCP is written in C. Additional assembler routines for both
Motorola and Intel &amp; compatible processors have been written for the highest possible
transfer speed. The source code is 100% portable between all platforms and
is compiled by GNU C 2.95.2 for all three destination operating systems -
the result is very efficient full 32-bit code.
<P>
The support of special features of various operating systems is a matter
of well written GNU C libraries (MiNTlibs on Atari and DJGPP libs on DOS).
<P>
It should be relatively simple to port PARCP to another platform with GNU C compiler
and a little knowledge of the parallel port programming.
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Features7"></A>   1.4.6 New features since last release
</H3>
<P>
The list of most important changes and features of new PARCP version compared
to previously released PARCP v3.90:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> PARCP-USB support
<LI> bugfixes, bugfixes and once again, more bugfixes!
<LI> ParShell allows to use numbers 1-9 next to function keys F1-F9
<LI> the new powerful EXEC command for running programs remotely!
</UL>
<P>
For more detailed informations please read the file <A HREF="history.txt">HISTORY.TXT</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Features8"></A>   1.4.7 Summary
</H3>
<P>
PARCP runs on Atari as well as on PC computers and clones, under all
known operating systems that provide DOS or TOS support. PARCP makes the best use of any combination of hardware and OS.
<P>
There are also other programs for connecting computers via parallel ports,
but only PARCP can connect any two computers thus you need not to learn how
to use many different programs. PARCP is also much faster than its competitors,
runs under more operating systems, it's simpler to use and supports multitasking.
<P>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Introduction4"></A> 1.5 Future Plans
</H2>
<P>
There are some things left to do, as well as a few things to fix.
The "to do" list is as follows, in no particular order.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> New, much faster transfer routines
<LI> On-the-fly compression and decompression of files for even higher transfer rate
<LI> Yes to All and No to All answers in the Overwrite dialog
<LI> Possibility of Rename in the Overwrite dialog
</UL>
<P>
Write me if you want another feature...
<P>
Other neat features would be:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> a port of PARCP to Amiga or Apple computers and mobile platforms
<LI> a native GUI for Atari GEM, Windows and Linux
</UL>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Introduction5"></A> 1.6 How much does it cost?
</H2>
<P>
PARCP is freeware since June 2015 thus it's available completely for free.
The author thanks sincerely to all the registered PARCP users that payed the original shareware
fee in previous 19 years. It helped greatly to keep this project alive.

<H1><BR><A NAME="AdditionalRequiredHardware"></A>2. Additional hardware
</H1>
<P>
Please note that when connecting two PC computers together, you can use
the well known LapLink cable (ask for Parallel LapLink cable in your
nearest computer shop).
<P>
Though for connecting an Atari computer to another computer (PC or Atari,
doesn't matter) you have to use PARCP cable.
<P>
<P>

*****************************************************************
* Note: you need not to build the cable, you can simply buy it! *

<P>
The following diagram shows you how to build your own parallel cable for
use with my PARCP (PARallel CoPy). This cable allows you to connect your
computer with any other computer if both machines have either bidirectional
parallel ports or UNI-BI adapter fitted.
<P>
The easiest way how to build the cable is to buy a cable for dataswitch.
It's usually marked as 25M-25M. That means there are MALE Canon-25
connectors on both ends of that cable. The cable has either 18 or 25 wires
in itself. The 18-wires one is sufficient for our needs, because PARCP uses
just 18 wires. When you buy that cable, you just need to exchange wires on
pins 1 an 11 at one ends of cable (and to cut the wires on unused pins such
as pin 10,12,13..17).
<P>
The PARCP cable should consist of just 18 wires. The wiring diagram is as
follows:
<P>

-->
<P>
The 'schematics' above wanted to say that all 8 data bits are straight
wires, while the Strobe and Busy signals are crossed in one connector. The
GND is connected in both connectors as well, of course (please note that
some cables do not have enough wires for connecting pins 18-24. In this
case it should be OK to connect just the 25th pin).
<P>
This cable also works with ST-Trans &copy; Atari 1992, with plip protocol of
MiNT-Net &copy; Kay Roemer and with HDD_DMN3 by MC Soft &amp; Hard.
<P>
Warning: if the cable length should exceed 5 meters, please get a cable
with proper metal shielding, otherwise random errors may occur during the transfer.

<H2><BR><A NAME="AdditionalRequiredHardware2"></A> 2.2 PARCP UNI-BI adapter (PC only)
</H2>
<P>
The UNI-BI HW adapter for PARCP is my own invention. It allows software to
use originally unidirectional parallel port of old PC's as new, fast
bidirectional one. PARCP can't use unidirectional port without this simple
hardware interface. In other words: if PARTEST.EXE detects your parallel
port as unidirectional, you must plug this interface into that port and let
PARCP know that the interface is plugged by line UNI-BI = TRUE in your
PARCP configuration file.
<P>
The UNI-BI adapter again is not sold anywhere, but when you know where the
iron gets hot you should be able to build one yourself.
<P>
You need to buy/find_at_home:

I think the *HC* is important, because both IC's eat current from PC's
parallel port and the maximum draw from it can be about 10 mA only IIRC.

<H2><BR><A NAME="AdditionalRequiredHardware3"></A> 2.3 PARCP USB adapter
</H2>
<P>
PARCP-USB is in detail described at <A HREF="http://joy.sophics.cz/parcp/parcp-usb.html">its own page</A>.
Generally speaking it's an adapter that is able to convert the parallel port of Atari (or a legacy PC) into a full speed USB port that can be
simply connected to other PC's USB port with a plain USB cable. There's no need for a special PARCP cable anymore. And PARCP auto configures everything automatically.


<H1><BR><A NAME="Installation"></A>3. Installation
</H1>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Installation1"></A> 3.1 Requirements
</H2>
<P>
<U>
   Atari PARCP:
</U><BR>
<P>
TOS PARCP comes in two versions (PARCP.TTP and PARCP030.TTP).
PARCP.TTP is compiled for MC68000 and therefore will run on every TOS
compatible machine.
PARCP030.TTP is compiled for MC68030, so it will not run on plain ST or STE,
including Mega ST/STE. It however will run on ST equipped with PAK68/3,
and of course on a TT030, Falcon030, Medusa T40/T60, Hades40/60 and all
other clones with processors MC68030/40/60.
Note: FPU is not required to run PARCP030.TTP.
<P>
Atari PARCP requires one ST compatible parallel port (driven by Yamaha YM-2149
and by MFP 68901). The Atari compatible parallel port is bidirectional
by nature, so for Atari you don't need any hardware interface...
<P>
<P>
<U>
   Common requirements for DOS version of PC PARCP:
</U><BR>
<P>
PARCP is full 32-bit application thus it requires an Intel 80386 or compatible
CPU (386SX will do, as well as AMD, TI or other equivalents). PARCP can't
run on 80286 or lower CPU, unfortunately (should not be a real drawback
nowadays, I think :-)
PARCP runs fine on all 486SX/DX, Pentium, 6x86 and other compatible
processors, of course.
Note: FPU is not required to run PARCP.EXE.
<P>
PARCP requires one PC compatible parallel (= printer) port, naturally.
You must specify parallel port's base address and the port's type to let
PARCP know which port it should work with. Don't be afraid, PARCPCFG will
do this job for you.
<P>
<U>
   PC parallel ports:
</U><BR>
<P>
Several types of parallel ports exist on IBM computers and clones. You can
find out what kind of ports are in your machine by running PARCPCFG.
Generally the better is to use PARCP Cable and a bidirectional, PS/2, EPP or ECP
parallel port. But if you're going to use LapLink cable only, you need not
to change the type of your parallel port - LapLink cable works with any
parallel port type. In other words, skip this section if you want to use
LapLink cable.
<P>
In most modern IBM and compatible machines you can use the Bios setup
(entered right after reboot by pressing the Del key, usually)
for selecting the type of your parallel port. For example on my machine
(Soyo 5VA motherboard) I can choose between SPP, EPP, ECP and ECP with DMA
modes. For PARCP the best is the EPP parallel port mode, though the others
work OK as well. But that again maybe a special facility of my Bios, so
please always select the EPP or PS/2 mode, if possible.
<P>
On some older additional ISA cards with parallel port you can usually select
the type of parallel port by setting up some jumpers on the board (see manual
of your motherboard/parallel ports card).
<P>
Both parallel port's base address and parallel port type as well as the
possible use of UNI-BI adapter are specified in PARCP configuration file
(see detailed description of that configuration file elsewhere in this
document).
<P>
<U>
   DOS specific requirements:
</U><BR>
<P>
PARCP is designed to be run in a DOS environment. It also works very well
under Windows95 and OS/2 in a DOS session. PARCP is a 32-bit application,
so it needs DPMI services to run in DOS environment. DPMI services are provided
by QEMM, 386MAX, Windows 3.11 and Windows95 (don't know about OS/2).
If you don't have one of these programs you can use CSWDPMI.EXE (it's enclosed
in PARCP distribution archive). All you need is to place CSWDPMI.EXE into
the %PATH% (e.g. C:\DOS) where the PARCP can find it and run automatically.
<P>
<U>
   Linux specific requirements:
</U><BR>
<P>
PARCP is compiled on Ubuntu 12.04 distribution.
Though I expect PARCP will work with any current Linux distribution (if
not, simply let me know).
<P>
In order to get permissions to access the parallel port hardware directly it must be run
with root privileges (i.e. run it when you are logged as 'root' - otherwise
it will ends immediately with a core file).
<P>
For use with PARCP-USB you want to configure your udev rule so you can then run PARCP as
a regular user. Copy the following snippet into your /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory and name the
file say <strong>parcp.rules</strong>. Then you need to trigger your udev to reload the rules using <code>sudo udevadm trigger</code>:
<P>
<code>
######### begin of parcp.rules #######<br>
# PARCP-USB<br>
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"<br>
######### end of parcp.rules #########<br>
</code>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Installation2"></A> 3.2 PARCP Concepts
</H2>
<P>
This section explains some concepts you must understand to figure out how to
run it and how to configure the PARCP options.
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Concept1"></A>   3.2.1 Server and Client
</H3>
<P>
When both computers are connected by the parallel cable, one must become
the PARCP Server and the other is then PARCP Client. The Server serves the
Client (it receives or sends files and does other things Client may want).
The Client is that machine you are sitting in front of, usually. Since
Atari computers' text output is a bit slower compared to PC computers, I
would suggest to use an PC computer as Client and Atari as Server, in this
constellation of computers.
<P>
As you may see, it's up to you which machine will be the Server and which one
will be the Client - it's not important at all, since PARCP behaves always
exactly the same on all supported platforms. The only thing you should do
is to run PARCP Server before PARCP Client.
<P>
Please note: if you run PARCP as Server on both computers by a mistake,
nothing happens. But do not try to run PARCP Clients on both computers,
that *might* be dangerous.
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Concept2"></A>   3.2.2 Running Server
</H3>
<P>
In order to run the PARCP as Server you have to put the -s on the command line
of PARCP (please have a look at the command line parameters section in this
documentation). You can also start PARSERVE program, it will run as PARCP
Server automatically (without any command line parameter).
<P>
<U>
 Example:
</U><BR>
<P>
  Atari users will double click on PARCP.TTP and write the -s parameter into
  the command line window then press Enter. They also can double click on
  PARSERVE.TOS.
<P>
  PC users will use a command line interpreter (either standard COMMAND.COM
  in DOS or Linux's shell or in Windows 'Run program') and type at the line
<P>
  <STRONG> parcp -s </STRONG>
<P>
  then press Enter. They could also type just
<P>
  <STRONG> parserve </STRONG>
<P>
  and press Enter.
<P>
After starting Server reads the configuration file and waits for connection
with Client. It will wait until a connection occurs or until you press the
Abort Key (it's the combination of Ctrl-leftShift-Alternate in all
operating systems except of the Linux, where it is Control-C).
<P>
Running PARCP Server simply waits for Client's commands. If it gets a command,
it does what Client wants and then it waits again for another command.
Server quits when it receives the QUIT command from Client.
<P>
You can abort the Server anytime by pressing the Abort Key, however
it's not recommended, since the Client couldn't know then that Server
is down already.
<P>
When the Server runs under a singletasking OS (TOS/DOS), the whole computer
is blocked until the Server exits. If you don't like this, then simply run
PARCP Server under a multitasking OS (MiNT, MagiC, Linux, Windows95, OS/2)
where it could run in the background. This way you can continue working with
your Server computer while it copies files in background, though the
transfer speed is slightly lower than under a singletasking OS (this is not
always true, I've been told that under Windows95 the performance sometimes
is even higher than under plain DOS...)
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Concept3"></A>   3.2.3 Running Client
</H3>
<P>
By default, when you run PARCP without any command line parameter it
runs as the PARCP Client. After reading the configuration file and
initialization the Client tries to connect with the Server for 10 seconds.
If it is not successful it exits back to desktop or shell.
<P>
After successful connection the PARCP Client:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Sends its actual parameters to Server
<P>
    Client sends the actual state of ProcessSubDir, CaseSensitive,
    ShowHidden, KeepTimeStamp, KeepAttribs, CRC, OverOlder and OverNewer
    switches as well as BlockSize, DirectoryLines and DirSort values.
    The Server's original values are overriden by Client's ones. That means
    you need to change these values on Client's computer only and they will
    be transferred to Server automatically.
<P>
<LI> Checks the actual size of screen and other computer parameters
<P>
    PARCP is smart - it tries to get the number of lines by
    ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ) and if it fails (or is not supported), environment
    variables "LINES" and "COLUMNS" are read. If the variables are not
    defined, PARCP counts on 25 lines with 80 columns (standard TOS/DOS
    screen size).
<P>
    Then PARCP finds out the type of computer it currently runs on and
    also the type of operating system by calling uname() function.
<P>
<LI> Executes possible script file
<P>
    If a script file was defined (by -B command line parameter or by
    Autoexec directive in PARCP configuration file) and the file exists,
    it's opened and the commands in it are executed line by line. More
    details in section 4.4.
<P>
<LI> Sends possible drag &amp; dropped files
<P>
    If there are other command line parameters than -F and -B, they're
    considered as names of files destined for sending to the Server. So
    they're sent and then Client ends. If QuitAfterDrop directive of Client
    is set to Yes, the PARCP Server quits as well, otherwise it will wait
    for another connection.
<P>
    This quick and easy way of copying files I call Drag &amp; drop mode, because
    I expect users will use this feature in GUI (such as Atari's desktop or
    Windows95 Explorer) and will copy files by simple dragging them over
    PARCP icon and dropping the files onto it.
<P>
<LI> Starts user interface
<P>
    If the Shell directive is set to Yes, ParShell (fullscreen user
    interface) is started, otherwise the CLI (FTP-like) is ready with a
    prompt line.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H3><BR><A NAME="Concept4"></A>   3.2.4 CLI commands
</H3>
<P>
PARCP CLI user interface is very similar to a ftp client's interface. If you
are familiar with FTP'ing you may need not to continue reading :-) Anyway,
read the next lines, for sure.
<P>
Client's commands are either without any parameter or allow/require one
parameter. There are three types of parameters:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> filename - that is a 'template' or a 'dir'
    'template' is basically a filename which can contain the wildcards
    'dir' is name of a directory or generally a path to a directory
<P>
<LI> boolean value: you must put there ON or OFF (or Yes and No, if you
    prefer it).
<P>
<LI> a number - that's just the PGLEN command's parameter
</UL>
<P>
 If the parameter is in brackets ("[parameter]"), it can be omitted.
 If you omit the parameter of DIR and LDIR commands they simply display
 all files. If you however omit the parameters of the other commands (HASH,
 CASE, HIDDEN, SUBD, KEEP, ATTRIB, CRC) they simply negate its value (from
 Yes to No and vice-versa) and display its new state.
<P>
<P>
<U>
 About wildcards in 'template':
</U><BR>
<P>
 The wildcards recognized by PARCP in the 'template' parameter are
 compatible with Unix's grep command and allows such specifications as
 *75.zip or * (equivelant to *.* in DOS lingo). Expressions such as [a-e]*t
 would fit the name "apple.crt" or "catspaw.bat" or "elegant".  This allows
 considerably wider flexibility in file specification.
<P>
 In the specified template string:
<UL>
<LI> `*' matches any sequence of characters (zero or more)
<LI> `?' matches any character
<LI> `\' suppresses syntactic significance of a special character
<LI> [SET] matches any character in the specified set,
<LI> [!SET] or [^SET] matches any character not in the specified set.
</UL>
<P>
 A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like 'character
 hyphen character' (as in 0-9 or A-Z).  [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the minimal set of
 characters allowed in the [..] template construct. Other characters are
 allowed (ie. 8 bit characters) if your system will support them (it almost
 certainly will).
<P>
 To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of `[]*?!^-\', and
 match the character exactly, precede it with a `\'.
<P>
<P>
<U>
 General rules for all commands:
</U><BR>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> If the commands begins with the 'L' letter, it's for the Local machine,
   i.e. for Client. Simple example is the DIR command - DIR lists files
   from remote machine (i.e. Server), LDIR lists files from local machine
   (i.e. Client).
<P>
<LI> Nearly all commands (GET, PUT, DIR, DEL, MD) act in the current working
   directory (CWD). The CWD can be changed by the CD command and enquired
   by the PWD command.
<P>
<LI> The path separator in Unix is forward slash ('/') while in TOS/DOS it's
   the backward slash ('\'). PARCP works with forward slashes internally,
   but understands the back slashes, too.
<P>
<LI> Unix mounts drives under normal directories while TOS/DOS uses the form
   drive:\path. If you want to change CWD on Server, please remember which
   operating system runs on it and use the appropriate form of CD parameter.
<P>
<LI> The resulting CWD is displayed in unified form /drive/path, which simulates
   Unix behaviour and is compatible with MiNT/MagiC way of mounting TOS drives
   under universal drive U:\.
<P>
   If you don't understand it, never mind. When PWD says "/d/tools" and Server
   runs on TOS/MiNT/MagiC, you know the working directory is on drive d: in
   path \tools\.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<U>
 The list of Client's commands is as follows:

<table width="100%" border=4>
  <tr><th width="30%">Command <th>Parameter
      <th>Action
  <tr><td><STRONG>QUIT <td>

  <tr><td><STRONG>LQUIT <td>

      <td>             When HASH is On, PARCP displays hash marks (dots :)
                       by every transferred block.
                       When HASH if Off, the transfer progress is displayed
                       by percentage of the length of transferred file.
  <tr><td><STRONG>CASE <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             This switch affects the filename matching on filename
                       case sensitive filesystems (minix, ext2). E.g. there are
                       files "Hello" and "HELL". With CASE ON you say 'DIR He*'
                       and only "Hello" is listed, while with CASE OFF the HELL
                       matches the "He*" pattern as well.
  <P>
                       Please note this switch does not affect VFAT/NTFS filesystems
                       because these are not case sensitive.
  <tr><td><STRONG>DOSCASE <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             When DOSCASE is Off, all files on DOS filesystem are
                       listed in lower case. This is just pure cosmetic.
  <tr><td><STRONG>HIDDEN <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             When HIDDEN is On, PARCP displays and process also
                       files with attributes HIDDEN and SYSTEM. This
                       applies to files on MS-DOS filesystem only.
                       HIDDEN is Off by default, i.e. hidden files are not
                       listed nor processed.
  <tr><td><STRONG>SUBD <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             SUBD switch affects PUT, GET, DEL and LDEL commands.
                       When SUBD is On, PUT and GET transfers also all
                       matching directories and its files. DEL and LDEL
                       deletes also matching directories. When SUBD is OFF,
                       the commands will transfer or delete just files and
                       not directories.
  <tr><td><STRONG>KEEP <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             KEEP On means that timestamp of copied files (date and
                       time of file creation) will be preserved. When KEEP
                       is OFF, the timestamp of copied files are set to the
                       actual time of copying of those files.
  <tr><td><STRONG>ATTRIB <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             ATTRIB On will cause the copied files to have
                       preserved the file attributes (on TOS and DOS
                       filesystem there are five attributes: READ ONLY,
                       HIDDEN, SYSTEM, VOLUME and ARCHIVE) and also
                       access rights (on Minix and ext2 filesystems
                       the user, group and other have different read,
                       write and execute rights).
                       ATTRIB is Off by default.

  <tr><td><STRONG>ARCHIVE <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             In Archive mode PARCP copies only files with Archive
                       bit set and this bit is then cleared. Purpose: easy backups.

  <tr><td><STRONG>CRC  <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             When the CRC is ON, PARCP computes a 32-bit Cyclic
                       Redundant Checksum of every copied block for 100%
                       safety of the data transfer. It's disabled by
                       default, since it slows the transfer down a little
                       and generally the transfer goes well without any
                       communication errors. But it's theoretically
                       possible to get a damaged file after copying (if the
                       data are lost in the parallel cable), so the CRC
                       directive is here for the absolute safety - when
                       enabled, it will force resending any damaged block
                       up to three times. If a block is sent four times and
                       is always damaged, the transfer is aborted.
  <tr><td><STRONG>PGLEN <td>[number]
      <td>             PGLEN sets the length of view page for DIR command.
                       PARCP is very smart in determining the size of screen
                       (it checks the TIOCGWINSZ and environment variable
                       "LINES") so you shouldn't need the PGLEN command.
                       If you would like to change the length of view page,
                       anyway, do it anytime by PGLEN. With PGLEN 0 the DIR
                       listing never stops.
  <tr><td><STRONG>SORT <td>[NnSsDdU]
      <td>             SORT changes the attribute the dir listing is sorted
                       by. You always specify only one character from the

                       n, e, d or s), you get the sorting reversed (i.e.
                       from 'z' to 'a', or from older files to newer, or
                       from bigger to smaller ones).
  <tr><td><STRONG>SORTCASE <td>[ON/OFF]
      <td>             When SORTCASE is ON the upper case filenames are sorted before

                       detects that a file with same name already exists in
                       the destination dir, it checks if the existing file
                       is older or newer than the file being copied. If
                       both files have the same time and date stamp, the
                       shorter is considered to be older (helps when a file
                       was not copied completely).
<P>
                       OVEROLD can hold three different values:

<H3><BR><A NAME="Concept5"></A>   3.2.5 ParShell
</H3>
<P>
ParShell is the new, fullscreen user interface of PARCP 3. It was created
for people not familiar with CLI and FTP commands. You need not to learn
anything in order to use ParShell - first, there are many programs very
similar or identical in ParShell look, and second, the ParShell is very
intuitive even for somebody who never seen Norton Commander in action. Just
press arrow keys, maybe F1 for a short help and that's all. The main
functions are mapped on function keys and are listed at bottom of screen -
so what else you need to know?
<P>
Basically, ParShell opens two windows on the screen: left window with
Client's and right window with Server's directory listing. You can browse
through the files with Up and Down arrow keys (for faster movement the
PageUp, PageDown, Home and End keys are also supported). You can also
switch between Client and Server window by pressing the TAB key.
<P>
You can also select some files by pressing the Insert key (unselecting is
done by Insert key as well, there are also the plus, minus and asterix keys
on the numeric keypad for faster selecting all files).
<P>
When you start a function by F-key press, it acts on the actual file - i.e.
on the file under the cursor. However Copying (F5), Moving (F6) and
Deleting (F8) act differently - if there are some files selected, they are
all copied, moved or deleted. Though if there are no selected files, F5, F6
and F8 affect the actual file (under cursor) as expected.

ParShell also uses two standard user interaction dialog boxes: MessageBox
and EditBox.
<P>
  In MessageBox you are presented with a text and several (one to three)
  buttons - you can navigate with Arrow keys (Left and Right) and Tab key
  between them. After choosing the right button you end the MessageBox by
  pressing Enter (or Return) key. You can also directly press a key with
  the first letter of button (for example press 'Y' key for the 'Yes'
  button). If there's a Cancel button, you can use the Esc key for choosing
  that.
<P>
  In EditBox you get some text and an edit line with blinking cursor: you
  can navigate in the edit line with Arrow keys (Left and Right) as well as
  with Home and End keys. You can also press Ctrl-Y (or Ctrl-X) for
  deleting whole edit line. You end the editting with Enter (or Return)
  key. If you want to discard changes, press Esc or Undo keys. At any time
  you can also press the F1 key for brief help.

<H2><BR><A NAME="Installation3"></A> 3.3 State of parallel port
</H2>
<P>
 Please note: you can easily skip the following section if you're going to
              use LapLink cable with PARCP or the PARCP-USB adapter.
<P>
 Standard parallel port is set to output state (all data lines are set for
 output) by default. It's dangerous to connect two parallel ports together
 with the PARCP cable when both ports are in output states. That's why I
 included the program PAR_IN into the PARCP distribution.
<P>
 When you run PAR_IN, it reads PARCP configuration file (to find out which
 parallel port you're going to use) and sets the parallel port into INput
 state. When one or both ports are in input states, it's OK to connect them
 by PARCP cable (even when the computers are turned on).
<P>
 When PARCP quits it lets the parallel port in input state (that's
 a must, otherwise your ports might be damaged). So after running PAR_IN
 or PARCP itself the port is in input state and everything is fine (you can
 disconnect/reconnect PARCP cable, or just let it be).
<P>
 However after rebooting of your computer (by reset, shutdown or power
 off/on) the parallel port is set to output state again. That means: if you
 will use PARCP regularly and have the PARCP cable connected all the time,
 you should put the PAR_IN program into auto start sequence of your
 operating system to ensure that the parallel port is switched to safe
 INput state as soon as possible after power on (or reset).
<P>
 I.e.: on ATARI put the PAR_IN.PRG into your \AUTO folder on boot drive. On
 MS-DOS, put a line "PAR_IN.EXE" into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. In Windows95
 put the PAR_IN.EXE into the StartUp folder.
<P>
 If you decide to stop PARCPing and start printing, you should:
<P>
<OL>
 <LI> remove PARCP cable
 <LI> turn off computer
 <LI> connect printer cable
 <LI> turn on computer
</OL>
<P>
 This is the only suggested method of cables reconnecting (because it is
 strongly prohibited to connect printer cable to running computer).

   Hardware
</U><BR>
<P>
Please note that on Atari computers there is no hardware configuration of
PARCP. Atari users can skip this section.
<P>
On PC you must configure PARCP for the actual hardware setup. Start
PARCPCFG, it will show you how many parallel ports you have installed.
Choose on of them by pressing number 1, 2 or 3. PARCPCFG automatically
checks the type of chosen parallel port and then asks you for the parallel
cable type - you can choose between PARCP cable and LapLink cable. At last
PARCPCFG asks you if it can update PARCP configuration file - Yes is the
right answer.
<P>
If the parallel port was detected as unidirectional, and you would like to
connect your PC with Atari computer, you would have to build and use
UNI-BI adapter - though if you are going to connect your computer with
other PC machines only, you can use LapLink cable thus need not to
build the UNI-BI adapter.
<P>
Generally speaking it's better to use PARCP cable for its higher troughput.
LapLink cables are, on the other hand, absolutely safe (you need not to use
PAR_IN). Anyway, if your port is detected as unidirectional and you have
more parallel ports, try another one, it might be bidirectional. If not,
you can always get a cheap (probably second-hand) ISA card with additional,
hopefully bidirectional parallel port.
<P>
Before connecting the cable please make sure the computers are on the same
electrical ground otherwise you will get a nice fire in cable and parallel
ports (You have been warned!). Putting both computers' power cables to the
same power outlet is always a good idea.

   Software

<P>
PARCP is configured through a normal ASCII file named "PARCP.CFG" by
default. You can edit it with any plain text editor to change the values
written there.
<P>
If PARCP is started and there's no PARCP.CFG file, it's created with the
default values. The default values are mostly OK, however on PC you are
strongly encouraged to start PARCPCFG first in order to generate (or
update) PARCP.CFG for the current hardware setup (look at the Hardware
specific section in chapter 4.1.1).
<P>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Installation5"></A> 3.5 PAR_IN, PARCPCFG (PC only)
</H2>
<P>
Both programs in PC version read the PARCP configuration file at startup
in order to find out which parallel port you use for PARCP and how to
program it.
<P>
All three programs will accept one command line parameter - a filename of
alternate PARCP configuration file. If there is no command line parameter,
PARCP.CFG is searched (according all those rules - first PARCPDIR, then
home dir and at last actual dir).
<P>
Please note that in PARCP you set the alternate config file with '-f'
switch, though PAR_IN and PARCPCFG take directly the first parameter as the
alternate config file.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<table width="100%" border=4>
<tr><th width="30%">Command <th>What happens
<tr><td><PRE GRAPHIC>PARCPCFG c:\port2.cfg </PRE>
    <td>it creates or updates configuration file named port2.cfg
<tr><td><PRE GRAPHIC>PAR_IN c:\port2.cfg </PRE>
    <td>this turns the parallel port to input state
<tr><td><PRE GRAPHIC>PARCP -f c:\port2.cfg </PRE>
    <td>and this finally starts the PARCP with the right config file
</table>

<H1><BR><A NAME="Configuration"></A>4. Configuration
</H1>
<P>
The configuration of PARCP is done by editing PARCP.CFG file (it's a plain
ASCII text file). PARCP reads it at startup. It searchs for the PARCP.CFG
at several places:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> if there's <STRONG>-f</STRONG> parameter followed by a filename on command line of
    PARCP, the filename is used as the configuration file for PARCP. There
    are no restrictions on the filename of configuration file - so you can
    have several favourite configurations predefined and choose between
    them when starting PARCP (example: <STRONG> PARCP -f C:\PARCP\config\port2.cfg </STRONG>)
<P>
  <LI> PARCP looks for PARCP.CFG where the environment variable <STRONG>PARCPDIR</STRONG>
    points to (example: <STRONG>PARCPDIR=C:\PARCP\config</STRONG>, PARCP searchs for
    <STRONG>C:\PARCP\config\parcp.cfg</STRONG>)
<P>
  <LI> if it fails, PARCP searches for PARCP.CFG in the directory where it was started
    from
<P>
  <LI> if still no PARCP.CFG found then it tries to locate it in the current path
<P>
  <LI> and at last it tries to seach for PARCP.CFG in user's HOME folder ($HOME on Linux, %HOMEDATA% on Windows)
</UL>
<P>
When it finds a valid PARCP.CFG, it will load it. If, however, it doesn't
find the PARCP.CFG file, it will create one in current directory and save
there the default values (handy in case you need to start editing the
PARCP.CFG from scratch).

                            file copying - just run the Server (usually by
                            a hotkey) and drop a file onto Client's icon...
  <tr><td><STRONG>CRC            <td>= [yes|no]

                            often the screen gets updated with progress
  <tr><td><STRONG>DirectoryLines <td>= <EM>number</EM>

                            one line in directory buffer takes 128 bytes of

                            the number of DirectoryLines, the rest of items
                            will not be shown! So put here a good number
                            (default is 256).
  <tr><td><STRONG>FileBuffers    <td>= <EM>number</EM>

                            (10 seconds) should be enough, but increasing
                            this value might help when the response time
                            from Server is too long and Client quits with
                            "Timeout" during DIR or GET commands.

<H2><BR><A NAME="Configuration2"></A> 4.2 Command line parameters
</H2>
<P>
Many command line parameters known from previous versions of PARCP have
been eliminated thanks to configuration file. The only valid options are:
<P>
<table width="100%" border=4>
<tr><th>Parameter          <th>Action
<tr><td>-s                 <td>run PARCP as Server
<tr><td>-f <configfile>    <td>path to alternate configuration file
<tr><td>-b <batchfile>     <td>filename of script that will be executed
<tr><td>-c shell/noshell   <td>overrides Shell=Yes/No in the config file
<tr><td>-c crc/nocrc       <td>overrides CRC=Yes/No in the config file
<tr><td>-q                 <td>run quietly, display nothing
</table>
<P>
The alternate configuration file can be used for different configuration
sets. When the entered filename of configuration file is valid, the
configuration file will have the highest priority and will be used
instead of other configuration files found elsewhere.
<P>
PARCP <U>Server</U> ignores any other parameters on command line.
<P>
PARCP <U>Client</U> takes all other words (without the '-' sign) on its command
line as names of files or directories to be sent to the Server. If your
environment supports so called `drag &amp; drop', simply put the files or
directories onto PARCP icon and they will be copied to Server (into the
current working directory of Server). The Client will exit after sending
those files. Whether the Server will quit as well or will wait for another
PARCP session is defined by the directive QuitAfterDrop (see 4.1.2).
<P>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Configuration3"></A> 4.3 Configuration under Client
</H2>
<P>
Under PARCP Client CLI you can change values of ProcessSubDir (SUBD),
CaseSensitive (CASE), Overwritting (OVER), KeepTimeStamp (KEEP), HashMark
(HASH) and CRC (CRC). All these changes are valid only in the current PARCP
session, after quitting it the values stay as they are in PARCP.CFG.
If you would like to keep the current settings, use the SAVE command to
store your settings into PARCP configuration file.
<P>
In ParShell you can change in addition the SmoothScroll option and enter
paths to External file Viewer, Editor and to Temporary directory. Similarly
to the CLI case above - if you want to keep the settings, you must Save
Settings (it's an option in the Pop-up menu - try pressing F9 key).
<P>
<P>


<H2><BR><A NAME="Configuration4"></A> 4.4 PARCP Script file (batch mode)
</H2>
<P>
PARCP is able to execute script files. This is a very easy method for
automatizing file transfers and other tasks, without user interaction.
Script file is just a plain text file with PARCP CLI commands. You can
prepare several script files and choose the right one with the '-b' option
on PARCP command line, or with the Autoexec directive of PARCP
configuration file.
<P>
Valid PARCP Script may look like this, for example:
<P>
<PRE GRAPHIC>
OVER
DEL C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
MD C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
CD C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
LCD D:\BACKUP
PUT *.ZIP
QUIT
</PRE>
<P>
As you may see, script is just several Client CLI commands, line by line.
If it ends with QUIT or LQUIT, PARCP Client ends as well. However if
there's no [L]QUIT command, the PARCP Client finishes processing of script
file and continues with normal run up to ParShell (or CLI, depending
on setup). This way you can, for example, set up your favourite working
directories with this simple script:
<P>
# script for setting up PWD and LPWD

CD C:\SOURCE

<P>
    The author accepts no liability for any damages to users or to third
parties, arising in any way out of the use of the PARCP, PARCP cable and

<H2><BR><A NAME="Miscellaneous2"></A> 5.2 Hints
</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> if you use PARCP regularly you most probably won't disconnect the PARCP
    cable from computers. Then it's important to start PAR_IN on one or
    both computers after reboot as soon as possible (because every reboot
    of computer sets its parallel ports to output state which is dangerous
    for the other computer connected by PARCP cable). That's why I suggest
    you to put PAR_IN.PRG into your AUTO folder (Atari) or PAR_IN.EXE into
    AUTOEXEC.BAT (DOS) or StartUp folder (Windows95).
<P>
<LI>You can break running file transfer immediately by pressing <STRONG>Shift+Control</STRONG>
    key combination (under Linux use <STRONG>Ctrl+C</STRONG>. The transferred file will
    be closed but not deleted so you'll end up with partially copied file.

</H2>
<P>
 What to do if PARCP does not start properly and ends up with one of the
 following messages:
<P>
<U>
 on MS-DOS:
</U>
<UL>
 <LI> "not COFF" - this basically means the file PARCP.EXE was corrupted. This
   is often caused by a virus. Solution is easy - delete PARCP.EXE, kill
   all viruses on your computer and then unzip the original PARCP.ZIP
   archive to get fresh and correct PARCP.EXE.
<P>
 <LI> "OMPT: file not found" - your PATH environment variable is not set. Type
   "set PATH=C:\" on your command prompt and the problem should disappear
   (it's a bug in DJGPP start up code, and should be fixed when DJGPP 2.02
   gets out).
</UL>
<P>
<U>
 on Linux:
</U>
<UL>
 <LI> "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" - this message is from Linux and
   appears when you forget to start PARCP with root privileges. Since PARCP
   accesses PC hardware directly you must be logged as root under Linux to
   use PARCP.
<P>
 <LI> "Error opening terminal:" - your TERMINFO variable is not set or
   terminfo database itself is missing. Please get one. On my Debian Linux
   terminfo database was installed, but I had to put
   "export TERMINFO=/etc/terminfo" into my /etc/profile script.
</UL>
<P>
<U>
 After PARCP starts but before connects:
</U><BR>
 Some people experience strange connecting problems when try to use PARCP
 first time. These problems usually resolve and then PARCP runs as they
 wish. If you get a proper cable and PARCP is configured properly (on PC),
 you should be able to connect two machines by simple starting server on
 one machine and then client on the other computer. If an error report
 appears, please note down the "Debug info:" values and send them to me. I
 believe we'll solve your connecting problems quickly.
<P>
 Several common causes of connecting problems:
 <UL>
 <LI> wrong cable
 <LI> wrong configuration of PC PARCP (wrong parallel port, wrong cable type)
 <LI> other resident driver of parallel port
 </UL>
<P>
 The last point is important - you should not have installed any special
 parallel port driver which would confuse PARCP. Very often you have
 installed drivers for parallel port harddrives, CD-ROMs, ZIP/JAZ or
 SyQuest removable medias or even network adapters. These drivers have to
 be disabled or uninstalled when PARCP should run, because they usually
 confuse PARCP by stealing data off parallel port.
<P>
 BTW, for MiNT users: please disable PLIP.XIF! :-)
<P>
 This is also a good reason to start trying PARCP from clean DOS or TOS and
 later (when you're sure cable and software is OK) you'll go into your
 favourite real operating system.
<P>
 If these general hints don't help and PARCP is still unable to connect,
 please note the values of "Debug info" on both machines and send it to me
 by e-mail.
<P>
<P>
<U>
 When PARCP runs, but not reliably:
</U><BR>
 If random errors occur in PARCP communications, first of all try to
 disable FastRoutines (use FastRoutines = No in your PARCP.CFG file).
 If you're in Windows95/98 try to reboot to clean DOS - Windows sometimes
 steals characters from parallel port.
 If communications errors persist please ask me for PARCP DEBUG (special
 version which documents all activities and problems into log file).
 Generally you should also use not very long cable (three metres is OK) and
 the cable should have proper shielding).

<UL>
<LI> ST-Trans &copy; Atari 1992 (Atari-Atari only)
     With simple GEM interface full of bugs and rock-solid but slow
     routines it's not a competitor for me. However I got inspired by the
     handshake method used there...
<P>
<LI> MiNT-Net (PLIP driver) &copy; Kay Roemer (MiNT-MiNT only)
     PLIP driver is a modified SLIP driver for parallel port. Can connect
     two Atari computers running MiNT and MiNT-Net. It's interrupt driven,
     so it's slower than PARCP. It's a real NET, though.
<P>
<LI> HDD_DMN3 &copy; MC Soft &amp; Hard 1997 (Atari-PC only)
     HDD Daemon is a complete solution for people with Atari ST without
     harddisk and with an PC computer. HDD_DMN will connect those
     computers so Atari is able to read PC's harddisk.
     Interesting piece of software, but a bit complicated for me.

<LI> PC2Am &copy; Michal Kara AKA Lemming (Amiga-PC only)
     PC <=> Amiga parallel network software. Powerful and fast (100%
     assembler). Helped me in the beginning with bidirectional parallel
