-----------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
-----------------------------------------
1) Install GCC 9.3.1 cross compiler from here: http://tho-otto.de/crossmint.php

2) Build libcmini by navigating to backends/atari/libcmini and typing make

3) A native GCC compiler for your OS is required for building a few tools

Note: I have been building this on MacOS 10.14.6
Your mileage may vary on other operating systems.


-----------------------------------------
Compiling:
-----------------------------------------
You can now build each game by running "make game=x" where x can be one of the following:
 monkey1 	- Monkey Island 1
 monkey2 	- Monkey Island 2
 atlantis	- Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
 tentacle	- Day of the Tentacle
 samnmax	- Sam 'n Max

You need to do a "make game=x clean" first if you have built another game before it.
The binaries end up in the /bin folder

makedist.sh builds everything and outputs them to the bin folder along
with the readme and the license.


-----------------------------------------
Building converter or test version for PC
-----------------------------------------
The standalone resource converter is built with "make -f Makefile.pc"

You can also build PC versions of ScummST using Makefile.pc
For example: "make -f Makefile.pc game=x"

These are quite useful during development due to the faster turnaround times.
You need some kind of recent GCC compiler and to put SDL1.2 inside backends/sdl/sdl
This is not meant to be fully playable and will appear quite broken
compared to the proper Atari version. It builds under Cygwin on windows.

Random todo notes:
-----------------------------------------

SCUMM5+6:
--> Get rid of virtual screen->backbuffer copy/movep
    Make scumm screen *be* the backbuffer in ST-Low. All drawing must be modified:
        - text
        - newgui
        - drawbox
        - bitmap
        - actor
        - bomp

        As well as VirtualScreen(s)
            Make all virtual screens point to different locations in same real screen
            Get rid of hasTwoBuffers. Always draw from original bitmap data.
            Get rid of vs->xstart and the scummvm scrolling method

        Drawbitmap:
            Store mask interleaved with planes

    Sound:
        Convert MONSTER.SOU to more suitable format?
            Avoid unsigned->signed conversion at runtime
            Maybe resample to a native DMA frequency
            Then, at least for DMA, we could play the original data directly without having to copy/convert it during playback
            (As a first step we could do the above at load-time, trading loadtime for runtime performance)

    Draw text to different screen to avoid masking.
        (Seems like this was done in later versions of scummvm already)

    Change int to int16 where applicable

    There are still a bunch of runtime checks that could be #ifdefs

    Make installer faster

    Improve disk loading speed

    Support demo versions properly

    YM music could be improved

    Add option for XBIOS sound output
